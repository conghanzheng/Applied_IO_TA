    "In this example, we perform structural demand estimation using the algorithm described in Berry, Levinsohn & Pakes (1995).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there are M markets indexed by $m = 1,\\dots, M$, and let $J_m$ be the number of options available to each consumer in market $m$. Following the exposition by Nevo (2000), the (indirect) choice-specific utility that consumer $i$ in market $m$ obtains from product $j$ (with $j=0$ representing the \"no-purchase\" option, that is, the outside good) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\tilde{u}_{ijm} = \\underbrace{x_{jm} \\beta_i + \\alpha_i (y_i - p_{jm})}_{\\substack{\\text{deterministic component}}} + \\underbrace{\\xi_{jm} + \\varepsilon_{ijm}}_{\\text{random component}}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $y_i$ is the income of consumer $i$.\n",
    "- $p_{jm}$ is the price of product $j$.\n",
    "- $x_{jm}$ is a $k$-dimensional vector of observed non-price attributes of product $j$ in market $m$.\n",
    "- $\\alpha_i$ is consumer $i$'s marginal utility from income.\n",
    "- $\\beta_i$ is the vector of tastes of consumer $i$, with $k$ dimensions.\n",
    "- $\\xi_{jm}$ is the unobserved (by the econometrician) attributes of product $j$ in market $m$.\n",
    "- $\\varepsilon_{ijm}$ is a mean-zero stochastic term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the utility from income, $\\alpha_i y_i$, plays no part in the consumer's choice, so actually we can just drop it out, or transform price $p_{jm}$ to $\\frac{p_{jm}}{y_i}$. From now on we consider the following monotonic transformation of the original utility specification:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "u_{ijm} = \\underbrace{x_{jm} \\beta_i - \\alpha_i p_{jm} }_{ \\equiv V_{ijm}} + \\xi_{jm} + \\varepsilon_{ijm}\n",
    " \\label{eq:main} \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Empirical Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Endogeneity of Price\n",
    "\n",
    "The key issue that motivates the BLP estimation approach is the endogeneity of price. The price of each product depends on all its attributes. Some attributes are observed by the producer but not measured by the researcher and are included in $\\xi$, yet they affect the demand and/or the costs for the product. Therefore, price $p_{jm}$ depends on $\\xi_{jm}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BLP approach to this problem is to move $\\xi_{jm}$ to the observed portion of utility. We separate the deterministic component $V_{ijm}$ into two parts: $\\bar{V}_{jm}$, the portion that varies over products and markets but not consumers, and $\\tilde{V}_{ijm}$, the portion that varies over consumers as well as markets and products. Thus, we can write:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " \\eqref{eq:main}: \\quad u_{ijm} &= V_{ijm} + \\xi_{jm} + \\varepsilon_{ijm} \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "  &\\equiv \\bar{V}_{jm} + \\tilde{V}_{ijm} + \\xi_{jm} + \\varepsilon_{ijm} \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "  &= \\underbrace{\\bar{V}_{jm} + \\xi_{jm}}_{\\equiv \\delta_{jm}} +\\tilde{V}_{ijm}  + \\varepsilon_{ijm} \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "  &\\equiv \\delta_{jm} + \\tilde{V}_{ijm} + \\varepsilon_{ijm} \\label{eq:step1} \\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\delta_{jm}$ is constant for each product in each market. A choice model based on this utility specification does not entail any endogeneity, a constant included for each market-product level absorbs $x_{jm}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One difficulty in decomposing $V_{ijm}$ into $\\bar{V}_{jm}$ and $\\tilde{V}_{ijm}$ is that all terms in the indirect utility \\eqref{eq:main} except for $\\xi_{jm}$ has a subscript $i$ (think about $\\alpha_i p_{jm}$, $x_{jm} \\beta_i$, and $\\varepsilon_{ijm}$). To describe how consumer preferences vary as a function of the individual characteristics, we model the distribution of consumer taste parameters $\\alpha_i$ and $\\beta_i$.\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  (\\alpha_i,\\beta_i)' &= (\\alpha,\\beta)' + \\Pi \\cdot \\eta_i + \\Sigma \\cdot \\nu_i , \\quad \\theta \\equiv (\\Pi, \\Sigma) \n",
    "  \\label{eq:rpl} \\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the average levels of the two parameters, $\\eta_i$ and $\\nu_i$ are the individual-varying part, and the second equality depends on $\\Sigma$ being diagonal. According to Nevo (2000), given that no individual data is observed, the individual characteristics consist of two components: the demographics $\\eta_i$ which is referred to as observed, and additional characteristics $\\nu_i$ which is referred to as unobserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we do not observe individual data, demographic variables $\\eta_i$ is still considered as \"observed\". We may not know the individual income of each agent, but we may know some feature of the income distribution. And finally we might have a sample from the joint distribution of several demographic variables (e.g., income, age, family size, race, and education, etc. from Census data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional characteristics $\\nu_i$ might include things like whether the individual owns a dog, which could be very important in the decision of which car to buy (suppose we are considering the automobile markets as in the BLP paper), but are unlikely to be collected by any data project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using \\eqref{eq:step1} and \\eqref{eq:rpl}, we can rewrite the original model \\eqref{eq:main} as\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  u_{ijm}\n",
    "  &= \\delta_{jm} + \\tilde{V}_{ijm}(\\theta) + \\varepsilon_{ijm}  \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "  &= \\delta_{jm} + (x_{jm},p_{jm}) \\cdot (\\Pi \\eta_i + \\Sigma \\nu_i) + \\varepsilon_{ijm}  \\label{eq:step1_ex} \\tag{4}\\\\\n",
    "  \\delta_{jm}\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$(\\alpha,\\beta)$ and $\\theta$ are all the parameters of the model, usually vector $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is called the linear parameters, and vector $\\theta$ is called the nonlinear parameters (the reasons for the names will be discussed below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Model \\eqref{eq:step1_ex} and \\eqref{eq:delta} tells us that $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ (the linear parameters) and $\\theta$ (the nonlinear parameters) are all the parameters we need to estimate in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Outer Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We proceed with the estimation of the choice model with utility specification \\eqref{eq:step1_ex}. Recall from last semester's Microeconometrics the additive random utility interpretation of MNL and CL ($U_{j} = x_j \\beta + \\varepsilon_j$). We get a similar form in the current case, only the parameters $(\\eta_i, \\nu_i)$ have randomness. A multi-choice logit model where the parameter $\\beta$ in the deterministic component are allowed to be random is called a Random Parameters Logit (RPL, also called a Mixed Logit). RPL model is suitable to model the aggregation over heterogeneous consumers (in our context, random coefficients actually means individual coefficients).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the unobservables $\\{\\varepsilon_{ijm}\\}$ are independent and type I extreme value distributed, the individual choice probability is\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  S_{ijm}\n",
    "  &= \\mathbf{P}(u_{ijm} \\geq u_{ikm}, \\forall k = 1,\\dots,M) \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "  &= \\mathbf{P}\\bigg(\\varepsilon_{ijm} - \\varepsilon_{ikm} \\leq \\left(\\delta_{jm} +\\tilde{V}_{ijm}(\\theta)\\right) - \\left( \\delta_{km} + \\tilde{V}_{ikm}(\\theta) \\right), \\forall k = 1,\\dots,M \\bigg) \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "  &= \\int_{\\varepsilon_{ijm}: \\, u_{ijm} \\geq u_{ikm}, \\forall k} \\mathrm{d} F(\\varepsilon_{ijm}) \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "  &= \\frac{e^{\\delta_{jm} + \\tilde{V}_{ijm}(\\theta)}}{\\sum_l e^{\\delta_{lm} + \\tilde{V}_{ijm}(\\theta)}}\n",
    "  \\label{emax} \\tag{6}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "We can integrate out the randomness (in our context, \"individualness\") from $\\eta_i$ and $\\nu_i$ analytically, and get the market share of product $j$ in market $m$:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  S_{jm}\n",
    "  &\\overset{\\eqref{eq:rpl}}{=} \\int_{\\nu_i} \\int_{\\eta_i} S_{ijm} \\mathrm{d} F(\\eta_i, \\nu_i \\vert \\theta) \\nonumber \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the integral in \\eqref{eq:ints} is multidimensional. BLP assumed that the distribution $F(\\cdot)$ is the product of $k+1$ independent normals (1 from $\\alpha_i$, $k$ from $\\beta_{i}$). The above integrals are typically evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation with $N_m$ (number of sampled consumers in market $m$) draws of $(\\eta_i, \\nu_i)$ from $F(\\eta_i, \\nu_i \\vert \\theta)$:\n",

    "  \\label{eq:markov} \\tag{8}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "In principle, other numerical integration method could also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Inner Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the choice model is estimated, the estimated constants $\\delta$ can be used as the dependent variable in linear regression \\eqref{eq:delta} to estimate $(\\alpha,\\beta)$. Since price is endogenous in that regression, it should be estimated by IV. BLP proposes **two instruments**: the average non-price attributes of other products by the same manufacturer; and the average nonprice attributes of other firms’ products.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before that, we need to first address **the issue that there might be a very large number of constants $\\delta_{jm}$ to estimate**: $J \\times M \\times T$ (number of products times number of markets times number of years).\n",
    "\n",
    "BLP provides an algorithm for estimating them quickly, within the iterative process for the other parameters. We already know that $\\hat{S}_{jm}$ is a function of $\\delta_{jm}$ and $\\theta$ from \\eqref{eq:markov}. For a correctly specified model and a given value of $\\theta$, contants $\\delta_{jm}$ determine predicted market shares $\\hat{S}_{jm}$ for each product, and therefore can be set such that the predicted shares equal actual shares: $\\hat{S}_{jm}(\\delta_{jm}) = S_{jm}$, at each trial value of $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of estimating the constants $\\delta_{jm}$ by usual gradient-based methods, the iterative procedure recalibrates constants so that $\\hat{S}_{jm}(\\delta_{jm}) = S_{jm}$. The constants are adjusted iteratively by\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\delta_{jm}^{t+1} = \\delta_{jm}^{t} + \\ln \\left( \\frac{S_{jm}}{\\hat{S}_{jm}(\\delta^{t}_{jm})} \\right)\n",
    "  \\label{eq:contraction} \\tag{9}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Please think about how the process \\eqref{eq:contraction} moves each constant in the \"right\" direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "BLP shows that the iterative adjustment process is a *contraction* mapping, such that it is guaranteed to converge to a unique set of constants $\\delta$. For any given value of $\\theta$, the calibrated constants $\\delta$s are uniquely determined (by the iterative adjustment process), that is, $\\hat{\\delta} = \\hat{\\delta}(\\theta)$. This implies that the choice probability $S_{ijm}$ is now a function of $\\theta$ alone:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "  \\hat{S}_{ijm}(\\theta) &= \\hat{S}_{ijm}(\\delta(\\theta), \\theta)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "The optimization of the whole problem is only over $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Nested Fixed Point Algorithm (NFP)\n",
    "\n",
    "For any given $\\theta$, the inner loop of the NFP \\eqref{eq:contraction} solves the share equations $\\hat{S}_{jm} = S_{jm}$ until the successive iterates $\\delta_{jm}^{t+1}$ and $\\delta_{jm}^{t}$ are sufficiently close.\n",

    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decide the numbers of draws $N_m$, arbitrary starting values $\\theta^{0}$ and $\\delta^0$. Draw random values for $(\\eta_i, \\nu_i)$ across $i = 1,\\dots, N_m$, from i.i.d multivariate normal (of length $k+1$) $F(\\eta_i, \\nu_i \\vert \\theta^{0})$. Approximate the integral $\\hat{S}_{jm}$ using \\eqref{eq:markov}.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use starting values $\\theta^{0}$ and $\\delta^0$ and the observed market shares $S$, solve $\\hat{\\delta}$ by the iterative provess \\eqref{eq:contraction}.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select arbitrary starting values $(\\alpha^0, \\beta^0)$, calculate the moment conditions $g(\\alpha^0, \\beta^0, \\hat{\\delta})$ using \\eqref{eq:mmt} and the starting weighting matrix $W^0 = g(\\alpha^0, \\beta^0, \\hat{\\delta}) g(\\alpha^0, \\beta^0, \\hat{\\delta})'$. Solve for the GMM estimates for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Update the weighting matrix using the estimates, iterate until the GMM estimates converges (recall the iterate GMM from last semester TA1). Take the converged weighting matrix and estimates as $\\hat{W}$ and $(\\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\beta})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Take the new values $(\\hat{\\delta}, \\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\beta}, \\hat{W})$, find a new value for $\\theta$, repeat steps (1) to (3), until the moment expression $g' W^{-1} g$ from \\eqref{eq:gmm} is close enough to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimates are consistent even if you don't iterate on the weighting matrix in step 3. While an optimal 2-step GMM or an efficient 1-step continuously updated GMM will improve the statistical efficiency (Nevo, 2000; Dubé et al., 2012).\n",
